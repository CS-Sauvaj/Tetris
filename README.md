# Tetris
The tetris game :p
Run java -jar Tetris.jar to launch the game.
You can also double click the Tetris.jar file.
Commands are arrows (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) to move the pieces, R to rotate, E to store and P to pause.
You can chose difficulty between 1 and 5 (1 is very slow and 5 is very fast).
Musics and game upgrades are in progress...
